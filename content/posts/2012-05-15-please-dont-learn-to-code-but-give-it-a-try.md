> This post is a response to Jeff Attwoods post [Please don&#8217;t learn to code][1] (15th may 2012). I agree with 90% of this post, but I wanted to present a slight twist:

I whole heartledly agree with Jeff when he say&#8217;s that its nonsensical that _&#8220;every-one should learn to program&#8221;._ Jeff offers an analogy about plumbing and he is correct in this regard. However I will need to re-visit this analogy later.

One thing that I did not agree with Jeff was the following:

> But I can also recognize plumbing problems when I see them without any particular training in the area

I think that kind of thinking is dangerous, we may _**think**_ we know what the problem is. But as untrained plumbers that assumption could be completely wrong. This for me is where the analogy in this case breaks down. Solving plumbing issues **does** require an understanding of the underlying hydro mechanics. As programmers we would not expect our clients to debug our software for us _(unless they happen to be programmers)._ Then why would we assume the reverse is true?

I think although I agree with the overall sentiment of Jeff, the opposite action should be taken. I think people should:

> &#8220;please don&#8217;t learn to code, but at least give it a try&#8221;

Why do I think that people should give it a try, is that not the opposite of what Jeff is saying?

Its a different approach, in my mind that does have a whole set of advantages:

* Unless some-one experiences something, you may not know if you truly like it _(bar the obvious of course)._

* By giving it a try, those that actually like will naturally pursue it further. The others will just not continue doing it. Its a natural filter.

* It gives the opportunity to those, that may not have otherwise had the chance.

* It will raise awareness of just how hard programming is, we can tell non-programmers that programming is hard but they will never really grasp it. _Until you &#8220;walk in another man&#8217;s shoes&#8221; or so the saying goes_.

**Summary**

Overall I agree with Jeff&#8217;s perspective, its almost common sense. However to re-visit the old plumbing analogy:

> Although its nonsensical for everyone to learn plumbing, it would never hurt anyone to give it a try. Even if you go away learning how to replace a washer. At least that will be one less leaky tap in the world.
