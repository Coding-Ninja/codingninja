    Job Titles Similar to belts. While belts hold up ones pant, titles hold up ones ego.

**Footnote:**

I&#8217;ve been meaning to post some new articles for a long while now. My last post was a few months ago. Although I have a few incomplete articles in the works, being demotivated does not help.

We was discussing job titles in IT, and seemed quite apt so I thought I would share it. Hopefully with this post I can kick start my own motivation!

_**Extra note:**_

Clearly this is does not apply to all Job Titles :)
