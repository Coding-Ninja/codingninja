As a burnt out developer I had started a blog in 2012, over the years I somewhat posted random programing related stuff and at one point I was evening doing it on the regular! But then I got busy getting burnt out again in the "real world" and my blog has bit rotted somewhat.

Coding Ninja is a blog focusing on programming and programmers. I'm a passionate programmer and sometimes a bit _impulsive :) ._ I needed a way express my thoughts and share things. I wanted to freely and openly express my views without worrying about _the official line._ In order to protect the innocent _(namely myself) :P_, I have chosen Coding Ninja. It helps that I happen to like both programming and Ninja's! (:)

That's pretty much the back-story, if you wanted to contact me for whatever reason then certainly drop me a mail:
